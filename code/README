This folder contains all code (mostly in R, some shell scripts...)

experimental/           -- code that is unsorted (works in progress)
misc/                   -- code for trying different ideas, not necessarily ODNB stuff
network_visualization/  -- code that produces static visualizations of networks
ODNB/                   -- code that processes the ODNB code & the model fitting => confidence matrix
other_data_sources/     -- code that processes other data sources (doesn't go very far)
topic_models/           -- code that roughly applies a topic model to the data -- mainly supposed to be a validation for the network estimate
